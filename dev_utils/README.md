## Tips on running the benchmark
You can use the `POST_TRAIN_BENCH_EXPERIMENT_NAME` to set experiment names for the benchmark, e.g. to distinguish experiments where you test and ones which are for actual results.
E.g. you can set `export POST_TRAIN_BENCH_EXPERIMENT_NAME="_testing"`.

Some useful scripts after running experiments:
- `dev_utils/list_cuda_not_avl.py` lists runs where the cuda check failed (those runs need to be rerun)
- `dev_utils/runs_no_metrics.py` lists runs where metrics.json was not produced, also try `--all` to make this list more inclusive. Sometimes final evaluation needs to be rerun.
- `dev_utils/contamination_list.py` to see runs where contamination occured (sometimes useful to check if the judge works correctly).

## For our internal cluster (MPI)
#### Env var
Set this in your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`
```
export POST_TRAIN_BENCH_JOB_SCHEDULER="htcondor_mpi-is"
```
Likely it is also good to set
```
export POST_TRAIN_BENCH_CONTAINERS_DIR="/fast/username/ptb_containers"
export POST_TRAIN_BENCH_CONTAINERS_DIR="/fast/username/ptb_results"
```
or similar. Substitute "username" by your username.
You will need to move your containers there after this this.

#### Gemini issues
Gemini sometimes runs into issues like "API Error: exception TypeError: fetch failed sending request".
This likely is a result of running to many jobs at once.
You can find such jobs with the `dev_utils/api_error_list.py` script.

You can use the submission file `src/commit_utils/single_task_gemini.sub` instead of `src/commit_utils/single_task.sub`, to only have 8 gemini jobs running at once (even if you submit more).

#### Huggingface Cache
If you point your huggingface cache to some subdir of `/fast`, first build the soft-file-locking container via
```
bash containers/build_container.sh soft_file_locking
```
Then download the huggingface cache inside this container.
You can start a shell with the container by calling
```
bash dev_utils/shell.sh soft_file_locking
```
